The Coronavirus outbreak originating in Wuhan has about 20% severe cases and 2% deaths. A typical incubation period is 3 days but it may extend to 14 days, and reports exist of 24 and 27 days. It is highly contagious with an increase from day to day of 50% in new cases (infection rate R0 of about 3-4) unless extraordinary interventions are made. If it becomes a widespread pandemic or endemic it will change the lives of everyone in the world. It is imperative to act to confine and stop the outbreak and not accept its spread. We provide these guidelines for individual, community and government action.

## Individual and Community Guidelines

* Take responsibility for your own health and share responsibility for the health of your neighborhood with awareness and discipline 

* Practice social distancing

* Avoid touching surfaces in public or shared spaces

* Avoid gatherings  

* Avoid direct contact with others, wash hands regularly, and wear masks when in close quarters with others who may be infected

* Cover coughs/sneezes

* Monitor for temperature or other early symptoms of infection (coughing, sneezing, runny nose, sore throat)

* Practice self-isolation if you have early symptoms

* If symptoms continue to develop, arrange for safe transportation to medical facilities following government recommendations; avoid public transportation, wear masks

* In areas of heightened risk provide necessities for members of your community without personal contact; supplies can be left outside doors

* Collaborate with others to create safe zones / safe communities. Discuss safety with family and friends, talk about safety guidelines, know who's following safe guidelines, set shared policies, follow-up and share with each other needs, concerns as well as opportunities. 

* Be critical of rumors and don't spread misinformation

## Community and Government Guidelines

* Where proximate to communities or countries with active infections, set up border checks for symptoms 

* Conduct 14 day quarantines for at-risk individuals entering into infection free areas

* In areas of heightened risk coordinate neighborhood teams for community door-to-door monitoring for symptoms using IR thermometers and personal protective equipment (PPEs)

* Neighborhood teams going door to door should also identify individuals who are in need of support services 

## Government Guidelines

* Prepare in advance strategic resources like masks, PPEs, and test kits, and establish distribution routes

* Identify areas where infections are confirmed or suspected

* Stop non-essential transportation between infected and uninfected areas

* Isolate individuals with suspected and confirmed infections separately for care in designated facilities with adequate medical resources, including Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) 

* People with symptoms should use a specially designed process to be taken to the designated health facilities for testing, avoiding public transportation or cabs

* Quarantine and test all suspected cases in the vicinity of an identified case

* Promote public awareness:

  * Typical symptoms and possible means of transmission

  * Emphasize its high rate of contagion and usually mild symptoms to encourage individuals to seek medical care

  *  Encourage better individual hygiene, including frequent hand washing, wearing masks in public areas and avoiding contact between individuals

* Stop public gatherings

* Pay special attention to prevent or monitor the health of people going in/out of high-density confined facilities like prisons, medical, rehab and assisted living facilities, nursing homes, retirement communities, dorms and hostels.

* Promote Community Responsibilities in infected areas

* In each neighborhood/community, select a group of people whose daily job involves frequent human contact. Monitor their condition daily to help detect infections and prevent contagion

* Engage in communication and distribution of resources to remote areas

* Coordinate with international communities and WHO to share information about case identification, patient travel history, treatments, prevention strategies, and shortages of medical supplies

* Plan for treatment of patients with similar symptoms that are not COVID-19 infected

* In areas with active transmission

  * Close places of worship, universities, schools and corporations

  * Restrict people to homes and provide support for necessities to be delivered without contact

  * Perform door-to-door searches for individuals with early symptoms and needs for services, with necessary PPE precautions, and with community engagement in the effort 

 
Business Guidelines 		 		 	 	 		

In this article, we will list various actions business can take to prevent the spread of Coronavirus. We include special considerations for Retail and Hospitality as well.
General

* Promote understanding among employees and their families of Coronavirus transmission and prevention.

* Develop customized organization policies to reduce transmission and arrange for meticulous implementation.

* Ensure employees know that when they have even mild symptoms they should not be at work locations or in-person meetings and they will not be penalized for sick days. Set up a reporting system for any cases.

* Ensure employees have appropriate health insurance policies so that they will not be afraid to seek out care when they have symptoms, even mild ones.

* Engage with local medical facilities to coordinate early rapid testing of employees for Coronavirus

* Prepare essentials (hand sanitizer, alcohol, masks, Infrared contactless forehead thermometers) in case the conditions deteriorate and employees don’t have access to those items.

* Strengthening the weakest links of the organization reduces vulnerability.

### Meetings, Travel and Visitors  	 		 		 	 	 		

* Replace in-person meetings with virtual

* Arrange for workers to work from home where possible

* Restrict travel to higher risk Zones (Red, Orange, and even Yellow)

* Eliminate non-essential travel

* Change ways of doing business to make seemingly essential travel unnecessary.

* Limit visitors and set policies to inquire and rule out visitors based upon their residential Zone status and business Coronavirus prevention policies. Check visitor symptoms upon arrival.

### Workplaces

* Promote flexible work hours, staggered hours, and shifts to decrease density in the workplace. The density should be reduced to less than 50 % capacity at a given time

* Employers should ask employees returning from places with confirmed cases, or having uncertain contacts during travel, to self-quarantine for 14 days before coming to the office. Employers should keep close track of their health condition, and report and seek medical care.

* Entry points should be manned with individuals having Infrared contactless forehead thermometers.

* Measure body temperatures of employees daily and provide them with masks where proximity with others cannot be avoided [1]

* Reroute traffic into the building to promote hand washing on entry and place hand sanitizer at the entrance of the office.

* Arrange employees to avoid clustering in elevators. Elevators should not take more than half of their carrying capacity

* Make sure each employee’s working space is separated by at least 3 ft, and each individual working space should be at least 25 square feet. For offices with large numbers of people, these minimum guidelines should be further increased

* Disinfect public areas, locales with heavy traffic, surfaces frequently touched

* If A/C must be used, disable re-circulation of internal air. Weekly clean/disinfect/replace key components and filters.

* Scatter dining, keep 3 feet distance while dining and avoid sitting face-to-face. Separate utensils and frequently disinfect. Cafeteria staff must be frequently checked for health

* Promote meal delivery rather than going out for meals. Arrange help for calls for food delivery and a location for contactless drop off and pickup of food in a hygienic area without lines.

* Consider how employees get to work locations and develop recommendations including avoiding public transportation, or careful hygiene including avoiding touching surfaces, hand washing and wearing masks in areas of increased risk

* The responsibilities of ensuring workplace policies on Coronavirus safety should be clear and accountable

### Retail and Hospitality

* High contact industries may be severely disrupted. Early and effective interventions may mitigate but will not eliminate the risk unless they are society wide

* The importance of making sure individuals with even mild cold symptoms from work involving contact with others cannot be overemphasized.

* Keep a clear log of each day’s contacts. So that if an infection is identified the business can alarm all possibly exposed to minimize risk and mitigate harm to employees and customers.

* No-contact methods for doing business should be developed and implemented including:

* Walk up window pickup and drop off service including ensuring adequate spacing in lines

* Drive by service

* No-contact home delivery

1. The use of masks is debated, we note that: (1) Any individual who has even mild symptoms should avoid contact with others and should wear a mask while in necessary public or private contact with others. (2) Wearing a mask should be accepted in public settings to prevent those who are sick from hesitating to or feeling stigmatized by wearing a mask. (3) While masks do not guarantee safety for a healthy individual and their availability may be limited because of higher priority need in medical settings, using masks where proximity to others who may be infected can’t be avoided dramatically reduces the risk of infection. (4) For high risk individuals (over 50 or with preexisting health conditions) and even for low risk individuals the consequences of being infected the advantage of using a mask overrides its limitations in areas of heightened risk.
